# Descent_classifier
(Stochastic) Gradient Descent for a logistic regression classifier and a linear SVM using only numpy. Works with onedimensional or multidimensional numpy arrays of input data.

This was originally a Jupyter notebook, but due to delivery limitations it is now a single python script, for experimentation it is advised to turn it into a notebook again.
